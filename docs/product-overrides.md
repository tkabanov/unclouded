# Product overrides (intentional deviations)

This document records **deliberate product and UX changes** requested by the project owner that **override** the Bubble IR export, Lovable prototype, migration specs (`cursor-impl-cycle/`), or client docs in `docs/`.

When implementing or restoring UI/flows, **prefer this file over Bubble/Lovable/client docs** if an entry applies.

## How to use

- Before mirroring Bubble IR, migration ACs, or client PRD text, search this file for the area you are touching.
- When the owner asks for a change that contradicts those sources, implement the change **and append a new entry** below.
- Each entry should state what was overridden, what we do instead, and why (reference client doc when applicable).
